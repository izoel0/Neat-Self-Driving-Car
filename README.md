# Neat-Car-Drive
A simple self-driving car trained using NEAT.

## Instructions

### You will be prompted with "Draw?"
- If you want to create/draw your own track, type anything.
- If you don't want to draw, just leave it empty.

### You will be prompted with "Test?"
- If you want to test an already trained AI, type anything.
- If you want to train a new one, just leave it empty.

### If you choose to draw, a Pygame window will pop up. Here's how to use it:
1. Draw the track you want. Left-click to create the path, right-click to erase.
2. Once you're done, just close the window. It won't actually close completely.
3. Click on the path where you want the car to spawn; the spot will be marked with a green color.
4. The car will start driving around. If you want to stop, simply close the window.
